/**
 * @brief Initializes the core MAC context and common MAC parameters.
 *
 * This function must be called once at startup by the entity responsible for
 * initializing the DECT stack (e.g., the DLC layer or main application setup)
 * before any other MAC operations or starting the MAC processing thread.
 *
 * It performs the following critical initializations:
 *  - Zeroes out the global MAC context structure.
 *  - Sets the device's operational role (PT or FT).
 *  - Sets or derives (if `long_rd_id` is 0) the device's Long RD ID.
 *  - Generates a random Short RD ID.
 *  - Derives the Network ID.
 *  - Loads default MAC configuration parameters (e.g., RSSI thresholds, RACH CW values, timer periods).
 *  - Initializes placeholder PHY latency values (should be updated from actual PHY capabilities).
 *  - Initializes common timers used by both roles (e.g., RACH-related timers).
 *  - Initializes HARQ process structures and their associated timers (via dect_mac_data_path_init).
 *  - Performs role-specific basic timer initializations (e.g., PT's keep-alive, FT's beacon timer).
 *  - Sets the initial MAC state to MAC_STATE_IDLE.
 *  - Initializes sequence numbers (PSN, HPC) and security context flags.
 *  - Initializes per-peer TX FIFOs if role is FT.
 *
 * Note: This function initializes the context but does *not* trigger the start of
 *       actual MAC operations like scanning or beaconing. Those are initiated by
 *       calling the respective role-specific start functions (e.g.,
 *       dect_mac_sm_pt_start_operation() or dect_mac_sm_ft_start_operation())
 *       after this core initialization is complete.
 *
 * @param role The desired operational role for this MAC instance (MAC_ROLE_PT or MAC_ROLE_FT).
 * @param long_rd_id The 32-bit Long Radio Device ID for this device. If 0, the function
 *                   will attempt to derive one (e.g., using hw_id_get()).
 * @return 0 on success, negative error code on failure (e.g., if HW ID cannot be read for derivation).

 * If the PSN wraps around to 0, the HPC is incremented. If the HPC increments,
