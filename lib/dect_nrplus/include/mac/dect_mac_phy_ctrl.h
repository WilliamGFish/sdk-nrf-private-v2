 *
 * @param carrier The absolute channel frequency number for the reception.
 * @param duration_modem_units Duration of the reception in modem time units.
 *                             A value of 0 typically means continuous reception if the

 * @param mode The RX mode (e.g., NRF_MODEM_DECT_PHY_RX_MODE_CONTINUOUS).
 * @param phy_op_handle An application-defined handle for this specific PHY operation,
 *                      used to correlate completion events. Must be unique for active ops.
 * @param expected_receiver_id The Short RD ID that the received PCC's Receiver ID field
 *                             should match (or be broadcast 0xFFFF if applicable to PCC type).

 *                             For unicast (PCC Type 2), this should be own Short RD ID.
 * @param op_type The MAC-level operation type (pending_op_type_t) that this PHY RX
 *                operation corresponds to (e.g., PENDING_OP_PT_SCAN).
