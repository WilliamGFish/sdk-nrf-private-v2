 * a HARQ timer expiring. It should only attempt to schedule one PHY operation per call.
 *
 * Its responsibilities include:
 *  1. Prioritizing and attempting HARQ retransmissions for active HARQ processes
 *     that are marked as needing retransmission, if a scheduled TX opportunity exists.
 *  2. If no retransmissions are pending/possible and a scheduled TX opportunity exists,
 *     and free HARQ processes are available, it attempts to dequeue new MAC SDUs (DLC PDUs)
 *     from the QoS-differentiated TX FIFOs (per-peer for FT DL, or generic for PT UL).
 *  3. For each SDU selected for transmission (new or retransmission), it prepares
 *     the full MAC PDU (including MAC headers, security if applicable) and requests
 *     the PHY control layer to schedule its transmission at the determined time and carrier.
 *  4. Manages HARQ process state (e.g., updating RV, tx_attempts, starting ACK timers).

 * and the remaining payload is identified as a MAC SDU Area intended for data delivery
 * (e.g., containing one or more MUXed User Data IEs).

 *                          after a MAC Security Info IE if that was sent cleartext.
 * @param mac_sdu_area_len Length of the `mac_sdu_area_data` (excluding any final MIC).
 * @param transmitter_long_rd_id Long RD ID of the device that sent this SDU. This information
 *                               is typically extracted from the MAC Common Header by the caller.
